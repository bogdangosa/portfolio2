            <p className="AboutText">Hi! Iâ€™m Bogdan Gosa and I am a passionate and enthusiastic Front-end Developer, always looking for opportunities to learn something new or improve on, eager on working with you on your projects.
            <br/><br/>My story with programming starts from a very young age. My first contact with programming was at school at age 10 when I had a class of programming. I was doing pretty good so my teacher sent me to an excellency class. At age 11 I already got to the national olympiad. At age 14 I got a bronze medal at the national olympiad. Then I started High School, in witch I started OOP, while also being in the robotics team. I tried almost every type of programming, from building small games to app development to programming robots. But after a while I started learning web development and I knew this is what I liked the most, so I started learning. I worked hard to develop my skills and I built some cool projects along the way.</p>
